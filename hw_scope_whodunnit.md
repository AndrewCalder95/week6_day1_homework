# Scope Homework: Who Dunnit

### Learning Objectives

- Understand function scope
- Know the difference in between the let and const keywords

## Brief

Using your knowledge about scope and variable declarations in JavaScript, look at the following code snippets and predict what the output or error will be and why. Copy the following episodes into a JavaScript file and add comments under each one detailing the reason for your predicted output.

### MVP

#### Episode 1

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Library',
  weapon: 'Rope'
};

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${scenario.murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
<!-- Miss Scarlet is the murderer - the murderer is declared within an object and then called by the function declareMurderer -->

#### Episode 2

```js
const murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```
<!-- Professor Plum is the murderer - the variable is constant so can't be redefined by changeMurderer and this gives an error -->

#### Episode 3

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const declareMurderer = function() {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const firstVerdict = declareMurderer();
console.log('First Verdict: ', firstVerdict);

const secondVerdict = `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
console.log('Second Verdict: ', secondVerdict);
```
<!-- Both Mrs Peacock and Professor Plum are declared murderers - declareMurderer redefines the murderer to Mrs Peacock and then secondVerdict refers to the first let  -->

#### Episode 4

```js
let suspectOne = 'Miss Scarlet';
let suspectTwo = 'Professor Plum';
let suspectThree = 'Mrs. Peacock';

const declareAllSuspects = function() {
  let suspectThree = 'Colonel Mustard';
  return `The suspects are ${suspectOne}, ${suspectTwo}, ${suspectThree}.`;
}

const suspects = declareAllSuspects();
console.log(suspects);
console.log(`Suspect three is ${suspectThree}.`);
```
<!-- When all suspects are declared they will be Miss Scarlett, Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard. When Suspect three is declared individually it will be Mrs. Peacock as Colonel Mustard was only updated within declareAllSuspects. The initial variable remained unchanged.  -->

#### Episode 5

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Miss Scarlet',
  room: 'Kitchen',
  weapon: 'Candle Stick'
};

const changeWeapon = function(newWeapon) {
  scenario.weapon = newWeapon;
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is the ${scenario.weapon}.`;
}

changeWeapon('Revolver');
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```

<!-- The weapon will be declared as Revolver. When changeWeapon is called this changes the weapon to revolver and then declareWeapon uses this updated weapon within its function when called.  -->

#### Episode 6

```js
let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    murderer = 'Mrs. White';
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function () {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

<!-- Mrs White will be declared murder. When plotTwist is called the murderer is updated to Mrs White. When changeMurderer is called the murderer has already been stored as Mrs White within the variable declareMurderer.  -->

#### Episode 7

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

const changeMurderer = function() {
  murderer = 'Mr. Green';

  const plotTwist = function() {
    let murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';

    const unexpectedOutcome = function() {
      murderer = 'Miss Scarlet';
    }

    unexpectedOutcome();
  }

  plotTwist();
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

changeMurderer();
const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

<!-- Mr Green is the murderer. The murderer is Miss Scarlet up to the point When changeMurderer is called and this switches the murderer to Mr Green. plotTwist doesn't make a difference as the let cannot be redeclared. -->

#### Episode 8

```js
const scenario = {
  murderer: 'Mrs. Peacock',
  room: 'Conservatory',
  weapon: 'Lead Pipe'
};

const changeScenario = function() {
  scenario.murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
  scenario.room = 'Dining Room';

  const plotTwist = function(room) {
    if (scenario.room === room) {
      scenario.murderer = 'Colonel Mustard';
    }

    const unexpectedOutcome = function(murderer) {
      if (scenario.murderer === murderer) {
        scenario.weapon = 'Candle Stick';
      }
    }

    unexpectedOutcome('Colonel Mustard');
  }

  plotTwist('Dining Room');
}

const declareWeapon = function() {
  return `The weapon is ${scenario.weapon}.`
}

changeScenario();
const verdict = declareWeapon();
console.log(verdict);
```

<!-- I initally thought the weapon was the lead pipe - having ran the function I can see it was candle stick because when the scenario is changed this satisfies the unexpectedOutcome if statement and changes the weapon.   -->

#### Episode 9

```js
let murderer = 'Professor Plum';

if (murderer === 'Professor Plum') {
  let murderer = 'Mrs. Peacock';
}

const declareMurderer = function() {
  return `The murderer is ${murderer}.`;
}

const verdict = declareMurderer();
console.log(verdict);
```

<!-- Professor Plum is the murderer - the murderer can't be redeclared so remains professor plum when the if statement is satisfied.  -->
